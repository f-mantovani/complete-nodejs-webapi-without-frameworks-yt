N-Layers

database - file that store all app data
src - all source code
  - entities - object mappings
  - factories - instances generators
  - repositiries - data access
  - routes - endpoint mappings
  - services - communication between the routes and repositories layers (business logic)
  - utils - shared code
  - handler - communication between routes and server
  - index.js - server instance

tests -> all automated tests suites
  - integatrion tests - testing on the user point of view. Also E2E test because there's no app consuming integatrion
  - unit tests - tests that must run without any external connections such as databases, external APIs (the fileSystem in that case)
